Scripts and Matplotlib plots for DS200
The Bar plot depicts the low intensity HESCOM installations in June 2022. We can see that the highest number of installations are domestic while water supply and public lighting installations are significantly less.

The Scatter plot compares the Water and Land pollution indices from various industrial zones to the Air pollution index of that zone. We can see that, in general, an increase in the Air pollution index is followed by increases in Water and Land pollution indices. This trend is more prevalent in the higher pollution indices as compared to the smaller pollution indices.

The Box plot depicts the Per Capita Income across the years. We can see that the per capita income has increased over time but the increase in the upper percentiles has been slightly higher as compared to lower percentiles.
